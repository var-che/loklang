# A talk about the how the language should look like

Just thinking outpaper, sorry for the grammar
I am an average programmer, meaning that the things that I want from
a language, will need most of the other programmers. Not gonna chase
some eccentric things that I have never used.

I like JS and Rust as well, and I feel like I would enjoy a language
that will look like them. Gleam is another one that I like. If the
syntax of the language does not apeal to me, I won't bother a lot.
Also, it is fun making a language of my own, for learning purpose.

I feel that the Pony language is a much better fit than BEAM languages.
It feels right, and I don't have the fault tolerance thing to think about.

Reference capabilities is where the things are at, it's just the matter
of make them not spooky.

## Desired things
- patter matching like gleam/elixir
- functions overload
- rusty/TSy syntax
- ability that you can do with Pony, you should do it with this one
- take inspiration for some things from Savi
