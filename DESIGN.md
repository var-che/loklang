# A talk about the how the language should look like

Just thinking outpaper, sorry for the grammar

I like JS and Rust as well, and I feel like I would enjoy a language
that will look like them. Gleam is another one that I like. If the
syntax of the language does not apeal to me, I won't bother a lot.
Also, it is fun making a language of my own, for learning purpose.

I feel that the Pony language is a much better fit than BEAM languages.
It feels right, and I don't have the fault tolerance thing to think about.

Reference capabilities is where the things are at.
